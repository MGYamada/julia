    "In order to get correct and unbiased results from QMC simulations, we need to implement a \"global updating\" algorithm in addition to the single-flip \"local updating.\" Here I try to rewrite the previous code using Channels to implement parallelization to show how it goes in Jupyter Notebook. However, in most cases ResumableFunctions.jl + MPI.jl is much faster, and you should use MPI.jl instead of using Channels. The implementation based on MPI.jl will be included in mcmc4.5.jl.\n",
