    "As seen in the Hubbard model calculations, Green functions are outputted as a function of imaginary time. In order to go to the real time we need analytic continuation. Analytic continuation of noizy statistical data is a difficult problem and there are many algorithms. Among them sparse modeling is the simplest and most generic way, so I will introduce analytic continuation using sparse modeling.\n",
