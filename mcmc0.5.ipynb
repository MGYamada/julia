    "## Why functional?\n",
    "\n",
    "One may claim that C/Fortran (or sometimes C++ without functional programming extension) is enough to do physics because they are fast, simple, and have enough functionalities. I agree with all the three points, but I think it is acceptable only when you are working only by yourself. Usually, a code by procedural programming is not easy to read, and is not human-oriented. In the procedural programming, you always have to use your brain to mimic how the computer works (is a human being a slave of computers?). Most computational physicists somehow got used to this way of thinking (already brainwashed) and wrote a code as readable to the machine as possible. Of course, it is ok if you are working by yourself and your collaborators do not care about your code, but today it is more important to share a code (via Github) and discuss physics on the Jupyter Notebook (maybe in old days it was enough to have one expert for computation and the others did not even have to see the code). In that case, it is important to write a readable, understandable, and well-organized code for everybody even without any comments!\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to define functional programming as human-oriented programming. If you want to get a mean value, why not apply a `mean` function onto the collection? Some (brainwashed) people may wonder if it is ok not to sum each time of the iteration to reduce memory, and so on. Such concerns will be resolved later by a concept of lazy evaluation (actually in MCMC6.0). Using this black box, you now do not have to care about at which step functions are actually called. Then, you can just apply statistical functions like `mean`, `std`, etc. just on the collection of data (called iterator) afterwards. This is exactly how we think when we process big data, and you can now write a code as you think.\n",

    "More strictly, functional programming may be defined as programming writing a code by compositions of pure functions. In other words, it is a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM). This notion is closely related to the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) because MCMC is nothing but a nondeterministic FSM. From physicists' view, it is a \"quantum\" version of the functional programming (rigorously, nondeterministicity here is not quantum), and every techinique in functional programming is applicable to MCMC, while in MCMC completely pure functional programming is impossible (software cannot produce any true random numbers by itself!). From now on, I will take \"pragmatism\" by using functional programming as much as possible, but by including a (pseudo)nondeterministic function additionally to make it work as MCMC. In this sense, I do not stick to doing completely functional programming, but use it as a tool to make a code readable. Unless it diminishes the readability of a code, I sometimes use a destructive function only if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia completely enables us to write a code as you think. You can use Unicode for variables, most linear algebra functions already exist, and Julia even discards class-based object-oriented programming, which is unnecessary for MCMC! Let's see the HMC function in MCMC1.0, and compare the function to the algorithm written above the function. If you are good at elementary mathematics, you can write a code exactly like you are doing math on your notebook. Like in [this pdf](https://github.com/MCSMC/MCMC_sample_codes/blob/master/review-MCMC.pdf), people unfortunately still believe that such \"how we think\" programming in Mathematica is useless. However, today in 2018, Julia and Jupyter Notebook work as a super-fast version of Mathematica/MATLAB, and Julia now works at a speed comparable to C/Fortran. Of course, if you wish to use low-level operations like SSE and AVX, we still need such procedural languages, but for most purposes, just calling BLAS/LAPACK functions is enough. Even more, Julia now supports GPGPU, so even for GPGPU programming Julia can be the first choice, instead of writing CUDA/OpenCL directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of notebooks, I will introduce not only MCMC but also functional programming, Julia-like programming, and in addition a Bayesian way of thinking. Think Bayesian, think functional, and last but not least [think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)!\n",

    "In functional programming, a program is regarded as one big function, and this is constructed just by a sequence of functions. In order to make those functions pure, it is important to write a function in the following ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do not use/write a destructive function.\n",
    "1. Do not include a side effect in functions. In other words, functions have to do things other than returning a unique value determined from the input.\n",

In some case, you need to use such destructive functions to speed up, and in this case you should take pragmatism. It is recommended to add `!` when you define a new destructive function. In some sense insertion itself is regarded as a destructive operation (or a side effect), but it is usually unavoidable and we accept destructive insertion if necessary from pragmatism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, how can we replace destructive functions like `push!` and `pop!`? In most cases, destructive operations on arrays can be avoided by iterators and generators (see MCMC2.0). However, for matrices and tensors we sometimes still need a destructive function to do operations in a memory-efficient way. In that case, of course we accept to use destructive functions as pragmatists, or you can formally write a pure wrapper function for the destructive operations to make your program look like a pure functional code.\n",

Including such I/O operations, something more than a mathematically pure function should do is all called a side effect. Some side effects are avoidable and others are unavoidable. It is important to reduce side effects as much as possible, but we as pragmatists accept useful side effects like I/O operations, insertion, control syntax, etc. On the other hand, the most important thing that you should have in mind is not to rewrite a global variable inside each function. Global variables should be defined always with `const` and even it is recommended to pass global variables as arguments."

    "Unfortunately, doing completely pure functional programming in Julia is not realistic. This is mostly because of the matter of a speed for numerical calculations. Most pure functional languages are not suitable for numerics and several times slower than C/Fortran. The speed and the referential transparency are in most cases trade-off, so you should not stick to the purity. In modern pure functional languages, referential transparency is almost always guaranteed, but in Julia you have to write a referentially transparent code conciously, which is a bit exhausting.
